# Ubuntu Puppet Git

Easy set up and management for Ubuntu 12.04 Server boxes using Puppet 3.0 and
a Git repository.

**NO LONGER BEING MAINTAINED**


## Overview

The idea of the project is to provide you with with some basic infrastructure
for managing your servers using Puppet and a Git repository and to ease testing
using [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com/). It comes with support for using
[hiera](http://projects.puppetlabs.com/projects/hiera) to configure your boxes
and [librarian-puppet](http://librarian-puppet.com) to manage the Puppet
modules your infrastructure depend on.


## Usage

Clone the project and run `rake setup:server` to bootstrap the server, keep in mind
that you will be asked for your password a few times during the process, thats fine
as it'll only happen once.

Please note that the
[server setup script](https://github.com/fgrehm/ubuntu-puppet-git/blob/master/scripts/server-setup)
was tested on a clean Linode Ubuntu 12.04 box, make sure you read it before trying
on a different distro or on an existing box.

If everything goes fine, the script will output the URL that you can use to set up
your remote repository to push your changes. You can then add Puppet modules to your
[`Puppetfile`](https://github.com/fgrehm/ubuntu-puppet-git/blob/master/Puppetfile)
and edit the manifests at the `manifests` folder. Every time you push your changes
to the remote repo, the Puppet manifests will be applied using the script at
[`scripts/apply-manifests`](https://github.com/fgrehm/ubuntu-puppet-git/blob/master/scripts/apply-manifests).


## Testing changes locally before pushing
