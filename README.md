# Ubuntu Puppet Git

Easy set up and management for Ubuntu 12.04 Server boxes using Puppet 3.0 and
a Git repository.


## Overview

The idea of the project is to provide you with with some basic infrastructure
for managing your servers using Puppet and a Git repository and to ease testing
using [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com/). It comes with support for using
[hiera](http://projects.puppetlabs.com/projects/hiera) to configure your boxes
and [librarian-puppet](http://librarian-puppet.com) to manage the Puppet
modules your infrastructure depend on.


## Usage

Clone the project and run `rake setup:server` to configure your local machine
and bootstrap the server. Please note that if you will be asked for the password
a few times, thats fine.

Please note that the
[server setup script](https://github.com/fgrehm/ubuntu-puppet-git/blob/master/scripts/server-setup)
was tested on a clean Linode Ubuntu 12.04 box, make sure you read it before trying
on a different distro or on an existing box.

If everything goes fine, the script will output the URL that you can use to set up
your remote repository on the server. You can then add Puppet modules to your
`Puppetfile` and edit the manifests at the `manifests` folder. Every time you
push your changes to the remote repo, the Puppet manifests will be applied using
the script at `scripts/apply-manifests`.


## Testing changes locally before pushing

More info coming soon...
